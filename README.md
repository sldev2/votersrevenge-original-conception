# votersrevenge
will host at least design artifacts for an application to form and grow punitive vote blocs; see http://tinyurl.com/oy45vt3 for overview (there was no response from either Trump of Sanders campaign, nor anybody else I approached)

see http://tinyurl.com/nhk2qvq for a requirements document plus links to mind maps (somewhat out of date; most important change: currently, only "wranglers" and "sheriffs" are defined for Coralin' type vote posses - i.e., users can only be voteslingers in a Voter's Revenge posse)

see http://tinyurl.com/oyohmg9 for some wireframes

design tools: sparxxsystems Enterprise Architect, plus Balsamiq (for wireframes) and Xmind (for mind maps); Balsamiq was kind enough to donate a free license for the purposes of votersrevenge - thanks!
